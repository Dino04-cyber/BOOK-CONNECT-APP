# Book Connect App

Book Connect is a web application for browsing and exploring a collection of books. You can search for books, view details, and even change the app's theme. It's designed to help book enthusiasts discover new titles and authors.

## About

This project was developed as part of my studies at [CodeSpace](https://www.codespace.co.za/), where I had the opportunity to learn and apply web development skills.

## Usage

Book Connect is an easy-to-use application with the following features:

1. Click on the search button to start exploring books. (Please note that the search feature is under development and may not work completely yet.)

2. Use the search options to filter books by author or genre. (As mentioned earlier, the search feature is under development.)

3. Click on a book preview to see its details.

4. Toggle between the day and night themes for a different visual experience.

5. Click the "Show More" button to load additional book previews.

Please keep in mind that some features are still a work in progress, and we appreciate your patience as we continue to improve the application.

## Changes

### Improvements

Here are the recent improvements made to the project:

- **Added Documentation Comments:** Improved code readability and understanding by adding documentation comments to explain functions, classes, and important sections of the code.

- **Created Book Class:** Introduced a Book class to better organize and manage book-related data and functions, promoting a more structured and object-oriented approach.

- **Extracted Preview Creation into Function:** Abstracted the process of creating book previews into a dedicated function, enhancing code reusability and maintainability.

- **Used Consistent Spacing and CamelCase Names:** Ensured code consistency by using consistent spacing and adopting camelCase naming conventions throughout the project.

- **Modularized Concerns and Reduced Duplication:** Reorganized and modularized the codebase to reduce code duplication and make it easier to manage different concerns separately.

## Resources Used

Here is a list of resources and tools used in the development of the Book Connect App:

- Styling: [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
- Version Control: [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- Code Hosting: [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- Text Editor: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Documentation: [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)

We would like to express our gratitude to the developers of these technologies and tools, as they have been essential in bringing this project to life.

## File Structure

The project's file structure is organized as follows:



- `data.js`: This file contains book information and data used by the application.

- `script.js`: The core functionality of the application is implemented in this JavaScript file. It includes functions for searching, displaying book details, and other interactive features.

- `index.html`: This is the main entry point of the web application, where the HTML structure is defined and where the application is loaded.

- `styles.css`: The CSS file used for styling the application and making it visually appealing.

Please note that this is a simplified representation of the file structure. You may have additional files or directories, but these are the primary files relevant to the functionality and structure of your Book Connect App.
